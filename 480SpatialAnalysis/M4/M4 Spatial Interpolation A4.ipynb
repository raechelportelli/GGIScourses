    "### Spatial Interpolation Competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be using the ordinary kriging method to interpolate the annual mean temperature data for two states: Arizona and Illinois.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Description of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature data were retrived from https://prism.oregonstate.edu/normals/. The original dataset covers the entire US with a ~4km by 4km grid. I clipped the data for Arizona and Illinois, and randomly sampled 200 pixels for each state, from this gridded climate product.\n",

    "\n",
    "Competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I have the \"true\" temperature data, I am able to assess your kriging fittings by compare your interpolated temperature with the \"true\" temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion I will be using is the root-mean squared error (RMSE): sqrt(mean(predict - true)**2)\n",
    "\n",
    "*** \n",
    "Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment worths 10%, the basic task is to use Kriging to interpolate the temperature for the two states. If you finish the basic task, you earn the full-credit. Additionally, we will have two winners (one for AZ, one for IL) who have the best interpolation accuracy. The winner will get 1% **extra** credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Several details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please use the lab jupyter notebook as a template.\n",
    "- Display the two interpolation maps (one for AZ and one for IL) in jupyter notebook as the final products, don't clear your outputs.\n",
    "- There are many parameters in `OrdinaryKriging()` that you can play with to better fit the variogram. For example, you can change the values in `nlags`, or `variogram_model`. The goal is to make the curve fits the variogram as better as possible.\n",
    "- Use the following code for generating the x and y of a 0.04 degree resolution grid (this is slighly differernt from the lab). \n",
    "\n",
    "    `grid_x = np.arange(xmin, xmax, 0.04)\n",
    "   grid_y = np.arange(ymin, ymax, 0.04)`\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Export your interpolated data using\n",
    "    `interpolated_krig.to_csv(\"il_your_name.csv\"`and `interpolated_krig.to_csv(\"az_your_name.csv\")`. And upload both to Learn when you submit your assignment. If you don't do this, you will give up your chance to win the extra credits.\n"
